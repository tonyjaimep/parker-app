- Component styling should be done through `nativewind` exclusively.
- For text components, exclusively use those in `modules/ui/components/text`. If another style is necessary, for the requested task, suggest creating a new one instead of using the `react-native` text component.
- `View` components should be imported exclusively from `react-native`.
- When creating screens, use the `Screen` component from `modules/ui/components/screen`.
- Files should be named using kebab-case
